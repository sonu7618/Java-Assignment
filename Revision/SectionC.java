a) final keyword
b) Getter and Setter Methods
c) Inheritance
d) try-catch block
e) do-while loop

b) Getter and Setter Methods
Getter and Setter methods in Java are used to access and update private data members of a class while maintaining encapsulation. 
A getter method returns the value of a private field, while a setter method sets or updates its value. This approach protects the data 
from direct access and allows validation before setting values.

c) Inheritance
Inheritance in Java is the mechanism where one class (subclass) inherits properties and behaviors of another class (superclass). 
It allows code reusability and supports method overriding to implement runtime polymorphism. The keyword extends is used to inherit from 
another class, enabling the subclass to use methods and variables of the parent class.

d) try-catch block
A try-catch block in Java is used for exception handling, allowing programs to handle errors gracefully. The code that may generate an 
exception is written inside the try block, and if an exception occurs, control shifts to the catch block, which handles the exception and prevents 
abnormal program termination.
Syntax:
try {
    // code that may throw exception
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // exception handling code
}

e) do-while loop
A do-while loop in Java is a post-test loop that executes the statements at least once before checking the condition. It is useful when the body 
of the loop needs to execute at least one time regardless of the condition. The loop continues executing as long as the condition remains true.
Syntax:
do {
    // statements
} while (condition);
